Course Overview
---------------

This course examines the social, cultural, economic, and political aspects of digital games. Topics include the socio-technical aspects of digital gaming, embodiment and space, communities, spectatorship and performance, gender, race, sexuality, e-sports and sports games, and the politics and economics of production processes, including co-creation and intellectual property. After successful completion of the course the student should be able to:

*   Demonstrate, through discussion and written work, an understanding of major areas within sociological computer game research.
*   Situate that analysis within a broader social theory framework.
*   Independently identify critical questions / problems / domains in the social and cultural analysis of computer games and select an appropriate method for examination.
*   Undertake a scholarly literature review relevant to the area.
*   Provide original analysis and argumentation via discussion and written work.
