Weekly Keywords
---------------

Each week prepare three keywords, drawn from each article / chapter, to bring to the session. We will put them all on the board to help generate discussion and unpack the material. The words can be terms you love, that resonated with you, that you didnâ€™t understand and had questions about, disagreed with, etc. Make note of a page number(s) the keyword can be found on so we can turn to the readings for context.

In-class Group Work
-------------------

In-class group work counts towards class participation, which is 20% of your final grade. Below is an example of an exercise from Session 3, which focuses on Embodiment & Materiality:
